			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Hi, I’m Ravneet and am currently a software engineering student at Thinkful. I am located in Burlington, New Jersey. I graduated from Rutgers University Camden this past May with a bachelors in business administration.

    <h2>About Me</h2><!--smaller header than h1-->
  <p>I’ve been taking this course for a few weeks now and have learned a lot of information. Web development is interesting because the code one is creating shows up as all of the visuals and elements that run a website. Collaborating with others is important on larger projects. It’s great to know everyone who does their part in a project is important. 
</p>

  <p>Some interests I have outside of web development are mostly online. I like watching videos of late night hosts, such as Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers. I like standup comedians. My favorite ones (including comedians) are: 
    <ol> <!--creates an ordered list-->
    <li>John Mulaney</li> <!--items in the list-->
    <li>Bill Burr</li>
    <li>Bill Hader</li>
    <li>Conan O'Brien</li>
</ol>
      
<p>I also like watching shows and seeing what others have to say about it on social media. </p>
