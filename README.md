Hi, I’m Ravneet and am currently a software engineering student at Thinkful. I am located in Burlington, New Jersey. I graduated from Rutgers University Camden this past May with a bachelors in business administration.

An About Me section that contains the following information:
I’ve been taking this course for a few weeks now and have learned a lot of information. Web development is interesting because the code one is creating shows up as all of the visuals and elements that run a website. Collaborating with others is important on larger projects. It’s great to know everyone who does their part in a project is important.

Some interests I have outside of web development are mostly online. I like watching videos of late night hosts, such as Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers. I like standup comedians. My favorite ones (including comedians) are:

John Mulaney
Bill Burr
Bill Hader
Conan O'Brien
I also like watching shows and seeing what others have to say about it on social media.
